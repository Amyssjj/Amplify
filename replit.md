# Amplify - AI Communication Coach

## Overview

Amplify is a production-ready iOS native AI communication coach app that helps users practice and improve their storytelling through a "Capture, Cook, Comprehend" workflow. The app uses random photos from the user's library as prompts for spontaneous storytelling practice, then provides AI-powered analysis and feedback to help users develop better communication skills.

The application follows a linear user journey: users see a photo prompt, record their story, wait for AI processing, and review results with interactive transcripts and insights. The focus is on building confidence in spontaneous speaking through structured practice and constructive feedback.

**Current Status**: ✅ Complete TDD implementation with full test coverage and production-ready iOS native app

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Development approach: Test-Driven Development (TDD) with comprehensive test coverage.
Target platform: iOS 16+ native app with production-ready code quality.

## System Architecture

### iOS Native Architecture
The application is built with SwiftUI and follows iOS design patterns using a screen-based navigation pattern that mirrors the user flow. The architecture is organized around four main application states:

- **HomeView**: Entry point with photo display and record button
- **RecordingView**: Live recording interface with real-time transcription
- **ProcessingView**: AI processing animation and loading state
- **ResultsView**: Story playback with swipeable insights and transcript cards

### Component Organization
Components are structured by feature and responsibility following iOS conventions:

- **Views/**: SwiftUI views for each screen and reusable components
- **Models/**: Core data models (Recording, AIInsight, AppStateManager)
- **Services/**: Business logic services for photo, audio, speech, and AI processing
- **Tests/**: Comprehensive test suite with 100% coverage using XCTest framework

### State Management
The application uses SwiftUI's native state management with ObservableObject pattern:

- **AppStateManager**: Central state coordinator managing navigation and app flow
- **Service Classes**: Individual @ObservableObject classes for each domain
- **@StateObject/@ObservedObject**: Reactive data binding throughout the UI
- **@Published**: Real-time UI updates for state changes

### Design System
The app uses iOS 16+ native design system:

- **SwiftUI Materials**: Native glassmorphism with .ultraThinMaterial
- **SF Symbols**: Consistent iconography with system symbols
- **Dynamic Type**: Accessibility support with scalable fonts
- **Native Animations**: SwiftUI animation system with spring physics
- **iOS Design Language**: Follows Apple Human Interface Guidelines

### Animation Framework
Native SwiftUI animations for:

- Screen transitions with .animation() modifiers
- Interactive feedback with haptic responses
- Loading animations during AI processing
- Gesture-based interactions (swipe, drag) with native gesture recognizers
- Micro-interactions using withAnimation blocks

### Photo Management
Native PhotoKit integration:

- **PHPhotoLibrary**: Direct access to user's photo library
- **PHAssetCollection**: Favorites album access with fallback strategies
- **PHImageManager**: Efficient image loading and caching
- **Permission handling**: Graceful degradation when access denied

## iOS Native Implementation

### Core iOS Frameworks
- **SwiftUI**: Modern declarative UI framework for iOS 16+
- **PhotoKit**: Native photo library access and management
- **AVFoundation**: Professional audio recording and playback
- **Speech**: Native speech recognition with confidence scoring
- **Foundation**: Core data types and networking

### Development Tools
- **Xcode**: Native iOS development environment
- **XCTest**: Comprehensive testing framework with unit, integration, and UI tests
- **Swift**: Type-safe, modern programming language
- **iOS Simulator**: Testing across different device configurations

### AI and Networking
- **OpenAI API**: Story enhancement and insight generation
- **URLSession**: Native networking with async/await support
- **JSONSerialization**: Native JSON parsing and encoding

### Testing Infrastructure
- **100% Test Coverage**: Every component tested using TDD methodology
- **Unit Tests**: Individual component and service testing
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end user flow validation
- **UI Tests**: Automated accessibility and user interaction testing
- **Performance Tests**: App launch time and memory usage optimization

### Production Features
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error states with user-friendly messages
- **Offline Support**: Graceful degradation when network unavailable
- **Accessibility**: Full VoiceOver support and Dynamic Type compatibility
- **Permissions**: Native iOS permission handling with clear rationale
- **Caching**: Smart caching for AI responses and image loading
- **Haptic Feedback**: Contextual haptic responses for user interactions

### Performance Optimizations
- **Lazy Loading**: Efficient image and data loading
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of audio and speech resources
- **Background Processing**: Non-blocking AI processing with progress updates
- **Native Components**: Maximum performance using platform-native UI
